# -UFO Analysis-

## Overview of the UFO Project

### In this project we helped Dana develop her UFO Sightings Webpage. We built a webpage that is interactive and dynamic, that accepts users' inputs and visually adjusts to reflect the interactions. We were able to build this by utilizing JavaScript and inserting it into HTML page, we also used our knowledge of CSS and Bootstrap to style the page, as well as some Chrom DevTools to test our code. 

### Dana's initial webpage was already working as intended, and filtered data based on the dates provided by the users, however, she wanted to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
