# -UFO Analysis-

## Overview of the UFO Project

### Our goal in this project was to help Dana develop an interactive and dynamic webpage utilizing JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap and HTML.

### Dana's initial webpage was already working as intended, and filtered data based on the dates provided by the users, however, sheâ€™d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
